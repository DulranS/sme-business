# Installation & Setup Instructions
"""
QUICK SETUP GUIDE:
==================

1. INSTALL OLLAMA:
   - Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai/download/windows
   - macOS: Download from https://ollama.ai/download/mac
   - Linux: curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

2. START OLLAMA SERVICE:
   - Open command prompt/terminal
   - Run: ollama serve
   - Verify at http://localhost:11434

3. DOWNLOAD AI MODEL:
   - Run: ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   - Alternative: ollama pull llama3:8b
   - Wait for download to complete

4. INSTALL PYTHON DEPENDENCIES:
   pip install aiohttp python-dotenv requests

5. RUN THE ANALYSIS:
   python enhanced_analysis.py

KEY FEATURES:
=============
✅ Enhanced RAG system with Sri Lankan economic data
✅ 5 job roles including cybersecurity specialist  
✅ AI automation risk assessment for each role
✅ Market saturation analysis
✅ Tech AND Non-Tech business opportunities
✅ Economic backing analysis for all sectors
✅ Tourism, healthcare, agriculture, food & beverage sectors
✅ Tech-enabled traditional business hybrids
✅ Investment requirement analysis
✅ Government policy and incentive tracking
✅ Comprehensive tables ranked by opportunity
✅ Local Llama 3.1 model (no API costs)
✅ Direct HTTP communication (no complex dependencies)

FIXES APPLIED:
==============
🔧 Fixed JSON parsing with proper error handling
🔧 Enhanced model detection (tries multiple model names)
🔧 Added connection testing and diagnostics
🔧 Improved timeout handling for large responses
🔧 Better error messages and troubleshooting
🔧 Added cybersecurity as 5th core job role
🔧 Enhanced RAG data with AI automation impact
🔧 Added fusion business opportunities
🔧 Multiple ranking tables for different aspects

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============
- Connection fails → Check 'ollama serve' is running
- Model not found → Try 'ollama pull llama3.1:8b'
- Timeout errors → Model needs more time, increase timeout
- JSON errors → Fallback data provided automatically
- Port issues → Check firewall/antivirus blocking port 11434

The system now includes comprehensive analysis of:
- Traditional tech businesses
- Fusion opportunities (AI + Cybersecurity, Cloud + Fintech, etc.)
- AI automation impact on each job role
- Market saturation levels
- Cybersecurity as a core specialization
- Enhanced ranking tables for better decision making
