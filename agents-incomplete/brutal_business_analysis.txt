• No business/legal knowledge - take courses or find mentor

HARSH TRUTHS:
• 90% of businesses fail because founders ignore cash flow reality
• Your 'innovative idea' probably exists - customer acquisition is the real challenge
• Sri Lankan customers will pay 30-50% less than you think and take 3x longer
• Government contracts sound great but take 2+ years and require political connections
• Most 'tech solutions' fail because they solve problems customers don't want to pay to solve
• Your friends and family praising your idea means nothing - only paying customers matter
• Import/export sounds glamorous but it's mostly paperwork, relationships, and cash flow management
• Service businesses don't scale - you're buying yourself a job, not building wealth
• Economic instability in Sri Lanka makes long-term planning nearly impossible
