Awful readme since it's one of my own goofy ahh projects . Any PR contributions are much appreciated, assuming that you're not sending a  virus

There are multiple things the scripts in here do from telling you what jobs are available based on yo ahh interests + uhh what kinda business models are good for you based off yaself and location etc. It's not the best, and a lot must be improved here 
Then it looks at the economic news (kinda) and tells you what is best to bet on as a business (aligning with broader economic ambitions, but that's optional). 
It also tells you what hybrid business opportunities exist and all that + uhh real estate and idk man it's a whole mess here so organize it a bit pls if possible

Business success is consistency and discipline, but this gives me 15 seconds of David Goggins motivation at 3 am, so yeah :)
