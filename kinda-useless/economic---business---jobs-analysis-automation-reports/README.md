As far as job demand goes, it checks for job saturation, market demand, AI automation, etc. 
Then it looks at the economic news (kinda) and tells me what is best to bet on as a business (aligning with broader economic ambitions, but that's optional). 
It also tells me what hybrid business opportunities exist lol

Busines success is consistency and discipline , but this gives me 15 seconds of david goggins motivation at 3am so yea :)
