SME Micro-Apps for personal business use only

Tiny, focused tools for small and medium businesses. Each micro-app solves a specific problem in your SME supply chain—fast to build, easy to use, and low on feature bloat.

Think of this as a sandbox for practical business tools—maybe one day, one of us makes something here becomes a full SaaS.

Small tools, real impact (or at least, less headache).
